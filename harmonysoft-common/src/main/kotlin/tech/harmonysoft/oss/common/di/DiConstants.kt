     * priority than production implementation.
     *
     * However, we can't exclude a possibility that end application would like to use its own implementation
     * as primary. That's why we don't want to use [Int.MAX_VALUE] for library primary implementation.
     *
     * This constant defines priority to use for library primary implementations.
